IP ADDRESS       -  192.168.50.126
SUBNET MASK -  255.255.255.0
 that means last 8 bits of subnet mask is 0. Hence address range
(192.168.50.0 - 192.168.50.255)

Network Address - 192.168.50.0
Broadcast Address - 192.168.50.255

So Available address range - (192.168.50.1 - 192.168.50.254)
No. of Devices - 256 - 2 = 254
